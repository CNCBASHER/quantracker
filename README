DIY Antenna Tracker using an STM32F4 discovery board.

Uses a Pololu style servo motor with encoder to give continuous Azimuth rotation
Uses a standard RC Servo for elevation.
Version 1 uses an Frsky Telemetry receiver and an Ardupilot to acquire the GPS data.
(See my mavlink_to_frsky project on Github for details)

I plan to incorporate other options for telemetry soon.

see my website http://www.softpainter.org for more info about the project

Written in C++11, requires gcc4.7 or higher to compile

Also requires my quan/ library also on Github.
